Python 3.6

A news banner application to show news headlines from http://www.nu.nl/rss/Algemeen

Use: python news_banner_v1.py

Exit by pressing "Escape" or the root window exit (X)

This program uses: tkinter, feedparser, time

feedparser can be downloaded at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser

Took me a long time to figure out how to ticker a text within a bounded window. In the end I found out
that frame was the appropriate method
